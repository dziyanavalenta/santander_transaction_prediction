    "The focus of this notebook was on detecting and handling outliers in the dataset to improve model training. Key steps included:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Outlier Detection**: Used the IQR method to identify outliers in each feature.\n",
    "- **Outlier Analysis**: Counted outliers in each target class to understand their distribution.\n",
    "- **Data Cleaning**: Removed outliers from the majority class (target == 0) while retaining all samples from the minority class (target == 1).\n",
    "- **Dataset Comparison**: Compared the shapes and target distributions of the original and cleaned datasets to ensure data quality and class balance.\n",
    "- **Preparation for Training**: Prepared cleaned training data and retained the test data for further model training.\n",
    "This process aimed to enhance the model's performance by reducing noise and potential bias introduced by outliers."
